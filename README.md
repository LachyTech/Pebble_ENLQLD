# Pebble Ingress Community Watchface

Ingress Community is a customisable watchface for both Enlightened and Resistance factions. It allows you to display your local community's name and motto on your wrist.  Due to limited display size, text fields are truncated and may not display your entire message.

# Installation
Access the link to the watchface on the Pebble App Store from your phone, and install to your locker in the Pebble application.

# Customisation
Open the Pebble application, scroll to the Ingress Community Watchface and press the "Settings" button. The settings page currently loads the default values for the Enlightened QLD community, but these can replaced with your own messages and faction option which will be persisted and loaded by the watchface.
